mongo db
express:- ready to use web framework for node js to develop backend
react
node :-js runtime to develop serverside scripts
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
*npm init -y ==>initialize nodejs application
*npm install express
*node xxxx.js==> to run the file//old fasioned
*if you want to use import statement, change type to "module" in package.jason which default is common js other wise, use require ("XXXX")

  - to get the environment port ==> const port = process.env.PORT
  - to exit  => process.exit(1); // exit with error process.exit(0;///// exit with successfully
  - to get current working directory => console.log(process.cwd());
  - Process info => process.pid        
                    process.version    
                    process.platform 
  - handleshutdown
